# Python - Everything is Object

Welcome to the **Python - Everything is Object** project!

This project explores one of the most fundamental principles in Python: **everything is an object**. You will dive into how Python manages objects, memory identity, mutability, and how different types (like lists, tuples, integers) behave when passed to functions or modified.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the difference between `type()` and `id()`
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects
- Predict the effect of operations like `+=`, `+`, `.append()` on object identity
- Know how Python handles assignment and memory references
- Understand how arguments are passed to functions (by assignment)
- Identify whether a value or variable is really a tuple
- Understand shallow vs deep copy and how to properly duplicate a list
- Apply these concepts in practical ways with examples and code analysis

## üìö Tasks Overview

Each task involves a small `.txt` or `.py` file to demonstrate understanding of Python‚Äôs object model.

### Mandatory Tasks (0‚Äì29)

| Task # | Filename | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | `0-answer.txt` | What function to use to print the type of an object |
| 1 | `1-answer.txt` | How to get the memory address (`id`) of an object |
| 2 | `2-answer.txt` | Do two variables pointing to the same value share the same object? |
| 3 | `3-answer.txt` | Do `a = 89` and `b = 89` point to the same object? |
| 4 | `4-answer.txt` | Does assigning `b = a` create the same object reference? |
| 5 | `5-answer.txt` | Does `b = a + 1` point to the same object as `a`? |
| 6 | `6-answer.txt` | `s1 == s2` for two identical string variables |
| 7 | `7-answer.txt` | `s1 is s2` for identical string variables |
| 8 | `8-answer.txt` | `s1 == s2` with separate identical string literals |
| 9 | `9-answer.txt` | `s1 is s2` with identical literals |
| 10 | `10-answer.txt` | `l1 == l2` for lists with same values |
| 11 | `11-answer.txt` | `l1 is l2` for identical list values |
| 12 | `12-answer.txt` | `l1 == l2` when `l2 = l1` |
| 13 | `13-answer.txt` | `l1 is l2` when `l2 = l1` |
| 14 | `14-answer.txt` | `l1.append(4)` effect on `l2` |
| 15 | `15-answer.txt` | `l1 = l1 + [5]` effect on `l2` |
| 16 | `16-answer.txt` | Does `n += 1` in a function change `a`? |
| 17 | `17-answer.txt` | Does `n.append(4)` in a function change a list? |
| 18 | `18-answer.txt` | Does `n = v` in a function change the original list? |
| 19 | `19-copy_list.py` | Return a new copy of a list in 3 lines max, no imports |
| 20 | `20-answer.txt` | Is `()` a tuple? |
| 21 | `21-answer.txt` | Is `(1, 2)` a tuple? |
| 22 | `22-answer.txt` | Is `(1)` a tuple? |
| 23 | `23-answer.txt` | Is `(1,)` a tuple? |
| 24 | `24-answer.txt` | Does `a = (1)` and `b = (1)` point to same object? |
| 25 | `25-answer.txt` | Does `(1, 2)` and `(1, 2)` share the same object? |
| 26 | `26-answer.txt` | Are two empty tuples the same object? |
| 27 | `27-answer.txt` | Does `a = a + [5]` keep same id? |
| 28 | `28-answer.txt` | Does `a += [5]` keep same id? |
| 29 | Blog Article | Write and publish a technical blog post on Medium or LinkedIn |

## ‚úÖ Blog Post Requirement

The last task requires writing a **technical blog post** in English.  
It must include code examples, be structured into thematic paragraphs, and include at least one image.  
You must publish it on **Medium** or **LinkedIn**, and share the link on **LinkedIn** at minimum.
